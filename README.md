=======
Guangqi (光启) is a 2D code, named after Xu Guangqi (徐光启), a Chinese mathematician and astronomer, who collaborated with Matteo Ricci in the 16th century. The code paper of Guangqi has been submitted and is under review. We shall publish the 2D version of the code as early as possible.

Guangqi specializes in solving the radiation transport equations with complex equation of states.

This repository hosts the 1D version of the code. We have used the code to study the [evolution of ejecta of CEE into LRNe](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...963L..35C/abstract), and the [accreting gas giant](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925L..14C/abstract). You can follow the PDF guide to reproduce a light curve that is similar to AT2019zhd.
